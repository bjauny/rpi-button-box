# rpi-button-box

## Description

rpi-button-box is a Raspberry Pi project to manage multiple buttons with light and sounds to manage quizz-like games. It is both an excuse to use the circle framework and a fun way to toy with my old RPi and do some electronics at home. Plus, it can be useful in family reunions or nights with friends to help play some games!

## Installation

Currently, rpi-button-box needs a full working circle setup, with the appropriate toolchain(s) installed. See circle setup guide for detailed steps.
The only further setup I made was to enable the headless option.

## Usage

Right now it works on a Raspberry Pi Model B R2. I haven't tested it on other boards because I don't own any and don't plan on buying another, but feel free to adapt it.
